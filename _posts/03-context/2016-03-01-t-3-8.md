TODO: Insert diagram

If your system interacts with many external systems, you could use UML port symbols
at to denote categories (or clusters) of such neighbours,
instead of showing all external systems as separate symbols.

That looks similar to [tip 3-7 (categories of external systems)](/tips/3-7),
but doesn't require the use of stereotypes and might save some drawing effort.

See the example below:
