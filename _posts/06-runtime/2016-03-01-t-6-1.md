The **runtime view** describes the behavior and interaction of the systemâ€™s
building blocks with one or more _scenarios_.

A **runtime scenario** shows specific interactions or behaviors of building blocks or building block instances, either with each other or external elements.

It shows _how_ the system fulfills certain tasks, _how_ the building blocks interact to achieve its desired results.
