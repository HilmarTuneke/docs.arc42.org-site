The _dynamic duo_, always two trainers in parallel, practically applicable
knowledge from Peter Hruschka and Gernot Starke. See [arc42.de](http://www.arc42.de/training.html) for details, and schedule.

We've successfully trained more than 1000 developers in software architecture,
many of them passed the [iSAQB CPSA-F](http://isaqb.org) certification.
(sorry - public training currently German-only, English for inhouse trainings.)
