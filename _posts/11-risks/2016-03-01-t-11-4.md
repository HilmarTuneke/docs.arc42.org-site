Some problems and risks originate from _processes_ within and around the system,
i.e.:

* requirements processes: If there's no agreed-upon and clear requirements process,
that may lead to problems in the long run.
* build-, release- and deployment processes can cause serious problems for systems.
* management processes: management and related decision processes might not aligned
with system requirements and/or quality goals
