Business or domain models or elements (data, activities, processes, services, tools, materials)
  will most often (and definitely should!) be reflected
within source code. For small or simple systems,
you might describe such elements within the building
block view... but:

Such business or domain elements will be referred-to from numerous building blocks,
and therefore be well-suited for a crosscutting topic.

Therefore: Document business or domain models or elements within arc42 section 8.
