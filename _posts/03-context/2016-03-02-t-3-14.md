Pay attention to quality requirements at external interfaces

Special quality requirements may apply to interfaces of your own system and
maybe as well to your external systems, e.g. safety, throughput or availability
requirements. These so-called "service levels" need to be treated with care,
because they may have high implementation and operating expenses and -risks.
