Blackboxes respect the information hiding principle: To use a black box,
you only need to know its responsibility and its input and output interfaces.
Additional details from its inner workings are (usually) not required.

This concealment provides a number of advantages:

* You can change or modify the inner workings, without users (clients, consumers)
needing to adapt to those changes.
* You might refrain from documenting the whitebox of this building block.
That can reduce the maintenance effort of your documentation.
* Eventually you reduce the level of details that some stakeholders have to consider
or know.

In extreme cases you restrict the building block view to level-1
(see [tip 5-3 ('level-1 is your friend')](/tips/5-3)),
the whitebox of the overall system - without detailling any of the
top-level building blocks.
